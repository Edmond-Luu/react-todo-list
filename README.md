This is the largest React app I have built completely from scratch as of now. It may seem like a simple todo list, but there are many features under the hood! [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was also used for building this app. 

##Here are the features of this application:##
* The user inputs 3 pieces of information for each note: the title (required), the description, and the category.
  * The color of each note depends on the category: personal (blue), work (green), other (purple).
* There is a red reset button used to delete all contents of all fields, if no information has been entered, the button will be disabled by default.
* Once the user is finished entering the information, clicking on the green submit button would save the information into a note that is displayed in the Todo Items section on the left.


The app is also fully responsive, meaning that it will automatically adjust itself based on screen size. For example, by default, on larger screens, the page is laid out in a horizontal format with the form and the pinned notes on one side and the unpinned notes on the other side. However, on smaller screens, the page automatically changes into a vertical format with the form, the pinned notes, and the unpinned notes taking up one column each. Each element would resize itself accordingly to maximize space and to ensure that the user is able to see as much content as possible.
